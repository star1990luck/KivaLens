# kivalensjs

A re-thinking and re-implementation of KivaLens as a React app rather than a Silverlight app.

Using React, Reflux, react-bootstrap, gulp, browserify, node, ES6, babel (JSX, ES6 transpiler), Kiva API,
linqjs, Highcharts, ...

Contact me if you're interested in contributing.

This is my first React app and there are a number of things that I'd do differently now... and will
eventually change. Don't judge too harshly. :D
